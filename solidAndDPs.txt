1. Code Maintainability
Why: As your project grows, the code can become harder to maintain, especially when it lacks structure.
Refactoring using design patterns introduces a consistent, organized way to structure your code. Even non-OOP languages can benefit from modular design and patterns such as the Module Pattern or Decorator Pattern, as it keeps the logic separated and focused.
Benefit: New developers (or even you in the future) will be able to understand the code more easily, reducing maintenance time and effort.

2. Modularity and Separation of Concerns
Why: Mixing different types of logic in a single function or module increases coupling, which means one change in the logic can break something elsewhere in the code.
By applying SOLID principles (e.g., the Single Responsibility Principle), you ensure each piece of code has a single, clear purpose. This also applies in non-OOP settings by keeping API calls, UI rendering, and event handling separate.
Benefit: More modular code is easier to test, extend, and modify without fear of unintended consequences elsewhere.

3. Reusability
Why: Without following patterns like Factory, Module, or Observer patterns, you may end up writing similar code in different parts of your application.
Refactoring with good design patterns encourages code reuse. Even in a functional context, you can make reusable functions or modules that can be applied in various parts of the app, reducing redundancy.
Benefit: Reducing duplication improves the ease of updates and debugging and ensures consistent behavior across the application.

4. Testability
Why: Refactoring towards good design patterns often leads to functions or modules that are decoupled from each other and more isolated in purpose.
This isolation makes unit testing and integration testing easier, as each function or module can be tested independently without complex dependencies.
Benefit: Well-structured code is easier to test automatically, leading to fewer bugs and regressions in the future.

5. Scalability
Why: As you add features to the application, having a well-organized architecture will prevent the codebase from becoming too difficult to scale.
Applying patterns like the Factory Pattern for generating objects or Observer Pattern for handling state changes dynamically can help scale the functionality without cluttering the codebase.
Benefit: Your application can grow with fewer obstacles, as new features and requirements can be added without refactoring large portions of the code.
